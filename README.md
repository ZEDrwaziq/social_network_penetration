# Social Network Penetration Testing Project

## Project Description

This project is part of a cybersecurity research initiative focusing on social network penetration testing. The objective is to simulate a phishing attack on a social network by hosting a fake Facebook login page on a local server. The goal is to raise awareness about social engineering attacks and network security vulnerabilities.

The project uses **XAMPP** to establish a local web server, **Kali Linux** for penetration testing tools, and the **Laravel framework** to create the web application. 

**Disclaimer:** This project is strictly for educational purposes and should only be used in environments where permission has been granted for penetration testing.
